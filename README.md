# Sokoban

This is a Sokoban-style Java SE multiplayer game written as a university project. Pure MVC architecture and the SOLID principles were the key aspects to follow during development. From 2 to 4 players can play in a game (on a single computer). Numerous playgrounds, spreadable liquids and visual customizations are available.
